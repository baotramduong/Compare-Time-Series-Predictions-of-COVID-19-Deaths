## Problem Statement

To contribute to the discussion of which model can be used for COVID-19 forecast, in this project, we will employ both Time Series Models, such as SARIMAX and Facebook Prophet, and non-Time Series Models i.e. machine learning models such as XGBoost and Neural Network. We will do a comparative analysis across these models and predict COVID-19 daily deaths.

## Data Source

We will use the COVID-19 Global Daily Deaths dataset by Johns Hopkins University for this project.Â 
This dataset is ranged from January 22, 2020 to August 16, 2020. The dataset is available in the time series format with date, month and year.

## Summary of Key Findings

|      |Model         |MAE   |
|------|--------------|------|
|0     |XG-Boost      |392.15|
|1     |Prophet       |572.56|
|2     |SARIMAX       |650.62|
|3     |Neural Network|728.0 |

## Future Work

* Build CNN or RNN models

* Build multivariate regression model with features such as vaccine coverage, hospital resource, mask use, social distancing etc.

* Include geographical, demographic and other facts.
